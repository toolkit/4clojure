;; TO DO - Still to solve

;; Problem 138 - Squares Squared
;; http://www.4clojure.com/problem/138

;; Create a function of two integer arguments: the start and end, respectively.
;; You must create a vector of strings which renders a 45Â° rotated square of integers
;; which are successive squares from the start point up to and including the end point.
;; If a number comprises multiple digits, wrap them around the shape individually.
;; If there are not enough digits to complete the shape, fill in the rest with asterisk
;; characters. The direction of the drawing should be clockwise, starting from the center
;; of the shape and working outwards, with the initial direction being down and to the right.

;; Origin Offsets:
;;                  0123    ----> x
;;           -2 "   0   "
;;      |    -1 "  1 0  "
;;      |     0 " 0 1 0 "
;;      |     1 "* 0 0 0"
;;     \|/    2 " * 1 * "
